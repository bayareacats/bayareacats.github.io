            <h2>Spay / Neuter</h2>
            <p>At the moment, many spay-neuter facilities are closed and the county programs in connection with vet clinics have lost funding. There are still options:
            <ol>
            <li>Try a shelter:
                <ul style="margin:0;">
                    <li><a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/animal-care-services/animal-care-services-2">San Jose Animal Care Center</a> for San Jose, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Milpitas and Saratoga. Email sjrescue@sanjoseca.gov for appointments. Limited number of surgeries per day. The general spay/neuter program has been cancelled.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.svaca.com/">Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority</a> free for Santa Clara, Campbell, Monte Cervino, and Mountain View locations only. Appointment only. Call to let them know location of the cats and situation.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NV23j2pA17WuPA996">Peninsula Humane Society</a>. Appointment only, ~2 weeks waiting.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Try a low cost vet like <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gt4fPXiUGSjtgfhC8">Animal Medical Center</a>, which offers services for feral cats. Males $55, females $75 (vaccines $25). Max 2 per day.</li>
            <li>Submit a request on <a href="https://www.alleycat.org/our-work/feral-friends-network/feral-friends-network-connect/">Alley Cats Feral Friends Network</a> for Veterinary Assistance and call the listed vets and rescue centers.</li>
            <li>Consider a regular vet like <a href="https://g.page/AHCSantaClara?share">Animal Health Center</a>, which was able to take a kitten on short notice and offer me a discount on medications and first visit care. In general, this vet is known to be fair with costs and they have great hours (open until 9 pm on Saturday).</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>The following are closed due to COVID and/or lost funding:
            <ul>
