They should see a vet within the first few days, if not the day of capture. Find a low-cost vet on the <a href="resources">Resources</a> page. Keep your own pets safe by  keeping the kittens separated from other pets and wash your hands and change your clothes after interacting with them.</p>

                <p><b>Feeding</b>. Kittens 4-5 weeks old will need extra care and might need some <a href="https://www.chewy.com/petag-kmr-kitten-milk-replacer-liquid/dp/125394?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=f&utm_content=PetAg&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Nj5BRCZARIsABwxDKLV-64XJbSSeSetwZ9YnulFFveKaY4RDfY76x5AiLblr5aCF_hh1vQaAucJEALw_wcB">kitten milk formula</a> depending on size. Ask your vet how often to feed them. When they are 5-7 weeks old, they can have 50% diluted kitten food with water. Good quality wet food brands include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X15H5RH/ref=twister_B07SPH2T2B?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1">Nulo</a> and <a href="https://www.chewy.com/weruva-cats-in-kitchen-goldie-lox-3/dp/120532">Weruva</a>. When kittens are 8 weeks old or so, they can be transitioned to solid kitten food such as <a href="https://www.chewy.com/blue-buffalo-sensitive-stomach/dp/35921">Blue Buffalo</a>.</p>

                <p><b>Litter box</b>. Depending on the size of the kitten, you can use a <b>shoebox lid</b> for their litter box. Otherwise use a small, kitten sized litter box. If they are struggling to use the litter box, decrease how much space they have and take away any extra blankets or towels. You can also place them in the litterbox a few times a day. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Best-Cat-Litter-28-Pounds/dp/B009QJYBVK/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=world%27s+best&qid=1596735680&sr=8-2">World’s Best</a> and <a href="https://www.chewy.com/arm-hammer-litter-clump-seal-multi/dp/105866?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=hg&utm_content=Arm%20%26%20Hammer%20Litter&utm_term=&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K75BRAEEiwAd41h1EkvT6NkUCM7rua1_JNP5voeBkEm4y974ANeHYxK0GuQJbZDHbhKihoCyjcQAvD_BwE">Arm & Hammer</a> both are good litters to start.</a></p>

                <p><b>Supplements</b>. A volunteer at Itty Bitty Orphan Kitty rescue gave me some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jarrow-Formulas-Colostrum-Gastroinestinal-Respiratory/dp/B0013OVTT8">colostrum</a> (1/3 capsule per feeding) and some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Ultimates-Probiotics-Cats-Litterbox/dp/B00RKQF6QA/ref=sr_1_6?crid=8GMZ251N0L9V&dchild=1&keywords=pet+ultimates+probiotic+for+cats&qid=1597606190&sprefix=probiotics+for+cats+petul%2Caps%2C220&sr=8-6">probiotics</a> (small pinch - ⅛ teaspoon per feeding for 3 kittens) to help their digestive system. Consult a vet before using.</p>

                <p><b>Socialization</b>. Expose them to vacuum cleaner sounds, trash bags, loud yelling, closing cabinets, strange noises, as many new people as possible, kids, other cat-friendly dogs or cats, both men and women, and anything else you can think of. Don’t give them too much freedom too soon, keep them in a bathroom or other small space so they don't have any hiding spaces (e.g. under the couch) or develop a bad habit to run. <b>Never let them play-bite, paw, or scratch at you, your hair or your fingers.</b> This is a very bad habit for adult cats. Any time they try to bite you, substitute your hand with a toy (preferably stuffed).</p>

                <h2>Vaccinations & Spay/Neuter</h2>
                <p>Kittens can be spayed or neutered once they reach 3 lbs. When they get fixed, they need to get a microchip. Low cost vaccination clinics can be found on the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page. This is a rough outline; check with your vet about what is best for your kittens.</p>
