            <h2>Adults</h2>
            <p>Adults must be trapped in a feral trap in order to be fixed and vaccinated at any rescue, vet, or shelter. <b>The cat cannot be transported in a homemade trap, carrier, or box.</b> If the cat is able to be handled well enough to be put in a carrier, it is not considered feral and does not qualify for the feral TNR programs. In this case check out general low cost spay-neuter clinics.</p><p>
            Males can be released the same day, while females need to recover for 24 hours in their trap with food and water. A good location for the trap is in the shower so it can be sanitized afterwards and is safe from other pets.</p>

            <h2>Setting traps</h2>
            <p>If possible, get the cats on a set feeding time two times per day. Trapping is most successful in the early morning or evening at dinner time. When you are trapping, it is important to withhold food so the cats are hungry enough to go in the trap. Have a mix of tuna, wet cat food, and a few dry kibbles. Make a line with the food on the towel leading toward the food bowl in the trap.</p>

                    <h3>Make a tunnel</h3>
                    <p>Always set up the traps like a tunnel, so it does not look like a dead end. This way, the cat will run into the trap to get the food thinking it has an excape route.</p>

                    <h3>Aligning traps back-to-back</h3>
                    <p>If you’re trying to catch the kittens and have trapped the mom, it is a good idea to align the cages back to back, so the kittens run in to be with their mom.</p>

        <p>Do not ever leave traps unattended for the safety of the cats and so the traps are not stolen. If you catch a cat, cover the trap completely with a large towel and use a removable zip tie to secure the trap closed.</p>
